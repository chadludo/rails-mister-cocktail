# A cocktail has a name (e.g. "Mint Julep", "Whiskey Sour", "Mojito")
# An ingredient has a name (e.g. "lemon", "ice", "mint leaves")
# A dose is the amount needed for each ingredient in a cocktail (e.g. the Mojito cocktail needs 6cl of lemon). So each dose references a cocktail, an ingredient and has a description.
